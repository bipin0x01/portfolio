# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
An infosec enthusiast, wannabe hacker and freelance web developer with content writing hobby. I love learning how things work. I shifted to breaking things after realizing that I was better at breaking than in creating, while working as a web developer. LOL :joy:

I spend most of my my time solving vulnerable labs, doing individual security researches and CTFs(more often).
